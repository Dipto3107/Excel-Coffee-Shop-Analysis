# Excel-Coffee-Shop-Analysis
I recently undertook a project to create a dynamic dashboard for our coffee shop, which involved several key steps from initial data preparation to the final visualization. Hereâ€™s how I approached this task:

Data Cleaning and Organization:

Importing Raw Data: I started by loading our raw data from the 'coffeeOrdersData.xlsx' file. This data contained various details like 'Order ID', 'Order Date', 'Customer ID', 'Product ID', 'Quantity', and 'Sales'.
Cleaning the Data: I noticed some inconsistencies and missing entries in fields like 'Customer Name', 'Email', 'Country', etc. I addressed these issues to ensure the integrity of our data.
Organizing the Data: I then restructured the data for better readability and analysis, ensuring that dates, product categories, and naming conventions were standardized.
Advanced Data Analysis:

Performing Calculations: I applied advanced formulas to calculate crucial metrics such as total sales, average order value, and sales per product.
Categorizing Data: I classified the data into relevant categories like coffee type, roast type, and size for a more granular analysis.
Trend Analysis: I analyzed sales trends over different periods to understand how our business has been performing over time.
Dynamic Dashboard Creation Using Pivot Tables:

Utilizing Pivot Tables: I used pivot tables to summarize our data effectively, creating various views like sales by product type and customer demographics.
Designing the Dashboard: I focused on designing the dashboard to be user-friendly and informative, highlighting key metrics prominently.
Adding Interactivity: I integrated interactive elements such as slicers and filters, allowing users to customize views based on their preferences, like specific date ranges or product categories.
Final Review and Presentation:

Reviewing the Dashboard: I thoroughly reviewed the dashboard for accuracy and functionality, ensuring that all elements were working as intended.
Finalizing and Sharing: Finally, I prepared the dashboard for presentation, making sure it offers clear insights for our business decisions.
This approach transformed our raw data into a comprehensive and interactive dashboard, enabling us to effectively track and analyze the performance of our coffee shop.
